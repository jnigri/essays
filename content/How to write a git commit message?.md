title: How to write a git commit message?
draft:
---

Limit the subject line to 50 chars.  
Write like you're giving orders.  
Start with a verb.

One line often suffices.

Limit the body lines to 72 chars.  
Explain how you tested the change.  
You haven't tested the change? Go do that first.

A template I like:
```
Add new feature

NOTES
-----

- This feature does X
- We did it because Y
- Also, it's related to Z

TESTS
-----

- I tested locally
- I went to the tool and clicked here and here
and then was able to see this and that

```
