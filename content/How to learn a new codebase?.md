If you are new at programming, pick a language and build small things first.  

Read the language specification from cover to cover.  
Then read the standard library from cover to cover.  

Don't stop for too long if you don't understand something.  
Yes it's going to be hard and tenuous.  
Yes it won't make you an expert immediately.  
This is a first step where your brain will index what's most likely the source of truth for this language.  

Then start to build things, and refer to that documentation when you have doubts. 
This is how you will become an expert.
