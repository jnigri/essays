title: How to code review?
draft:
---
Consider not making code reviews mandatory.  
When people can deploy, they own it.  
When people own it, they care for it.

You should comment.  
Reviewing is a chance to learn together.  

Suggest, don't command.  
Explain your reasoning.  
Give examples.  
Suggest a code change.  

Don't comment on formatting.  
Automate it.  

Batch your feedback.  
Post all comments at once.  
Context switching kills flow.  

Has the change been tested (even manually)?  
Approve.  

Does it improve the system?  
Approve.  

Does it add value?  
Approve.  

Does it fix something broken?  
Approve.  

Don't block progress for style opinions.  
Perfectionism slows everyone down.  

Trust your team.  

Pick your battles.  

Reviews aren't about control.  
They are about catching disasters.  
They are about learning from each other.  

The best reviews catch real bugs.  
Things that would actually break.  
Be a hero, find a real bug.
