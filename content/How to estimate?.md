title: How to estimate?

Don't spend too much time on estimates.  

Perfect estimates don't exist.  
They are guesses.   

"Man makes plans, God laughs."  

But estimates still matter.  
They tell you how much a project costs.  
They guide strategic choices.  
They prevent disasters.  

"A plan is nothing, planning is everything."  

Bad estimates destroy trust.  
Underestimate and you miss deadlines.  
Teams panic.  
Meetings multiply.  
More people get added.  
New people need time to learn.  
Everything slows down.  

Overestimate and work expands.  
Student syndrome: People wait until the last moment.  
Then rush.  

Software estimation is particularly complicated.  
We don't repeat, we automate once, computers repeat.  
Every project is something new.  
Only in repetitive work estimates can be accurate.  

Stop trying to be precise!  
Embrace the uncertainty.   
Get good at best-case, worst-case thinking.  

Example: Implement a service.  
Best case: Two hours if everything clicks.  
Worst case: Three days if complexity explodes.  

Practice these ranges.  
Calibrate your confidence.  

Don't aim for 100% accuracy.  
That's easy: every task takes zero to infinity.  
Aim for 90% accuracy.  
Take risks to improve.  

Projects have multiple tasks.  
Don't just add the ranges.  
You have ten tasks of 1 to 6 days each?  
Don't take the minimum (10), don't take the maximum (60).  
Think like rolling dice.  
Use normal distribution math.  
Aggregate the uncertainty properly.  

Take the 90th percentile of your final range.  
This gives you 90% confidence.  
Nine times out of ten, you'll finish on time.  

The math is complex.
